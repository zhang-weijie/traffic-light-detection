# traffic-light-detection

Development of an automated detection of traffic light signals. Imagine you are employed at windy.com to extend the API. The company was able to raise public funds to support road safety research. Within the framework of this project, webcam images showing traffic lights should be provided with information as to whether the traffic light is green, yellow or red.

This project includes a module that gets an image and the coordinates of the traffic light and returns the classification - red, yellow or green. It also has a GUI that can be used to check the functionality of your module.

Sample images from a webcam showing a traffic light and a configuration file config.txt with the appropriate coordinates can be found in the data folder.
